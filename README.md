# MeninoJava

MeninoJava is the final project for one of the courses I am taking at Universitas YARSI in the 5th semester. This project is an online movie ticket booking program developed using Java and incorporates four design patterns: Composite Design Pattern, Singleton Design Pattern, Factory Design Pattern, and Strategy Design Pattern.
